This piqued our curiosity in working with data from the American housing market, as we wanted to further understand what could drive housing prices. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought many changes to our lives, and we hypothesized that there were likely changes induced by the pandemic on the housing market. For example, stay at home orders could influence the number of homes purchased and listed and import restrictions could limit the raw materials needed to build new homes. In this project, we will explore housing market data from the popular real estate broker, Redfin, and attempt to answer the following questions: Is it getting more expensive for Americans to buy homes? Where are house prices rising and falling in the United States? What other interesting factors could drive prices in the American housing market? How has COVID-19 accelerated or reversed trends in the housing market? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Redfin is an online real estate brokerage that allows users to list their own homes and be matched with real estate agent to sell or purchase a home. Redfin collects data on all the homes sold and listed on their platform and makes this data available to the public. Many of the variables included contain common information on the real estate transactions on Redfin (listing price, square footage, sale price, location, time on market, etc.). This data is obviously not perfectly representative of the entire housing market, as not all American homes are bought or sold using Redfin. However, Redfin has extremely high market penetration in all but a few of the states, and provided us with a large amount of samples of homes in all kinds of categories (urban vs suburban, large vs small, expensive vs cheap). Crucially, since Redfin is online, they were also able to continue collecting data throughout the pandemic. Thus, we decided that this dataset would be a representative enough sample of the American housing market. Redfin gives users the option to download data that is grouped by state, metro area, city, zip code or even neighborhood. Since we did not need the extra functionality of more precise location data for our analysis, we decided to choose the state data. The only problems that we noticed with the dataset was that for a few variables the following states did not have data collected: Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming. Types of Variables: Categorical variables: “state”, “state_code”, “property_type”, “parent_metro_region” Quantitative variables: “median_sale_price”, “median_list_price”, “median_ppsf”, “median_list_ppsf”, “homes_sold”, “new_listings”, “inventory”, “months_of_supply”, “avg_sale_to_list”, “sold_above_list”, “off_market_in_two_weeks” Number of Records: 26624 rows To find a download link to the dataset, please visit the Redfin Data Center: https://www.redfin.com/news/data-center/ For more information on the contents of each variable, please refer to the codebook: https://www.redfin.com/news/data-center-metrics-definitions/ "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation The process of importing the data into R was extremely smooth. We downloaded the data from Redfin, extracted it and then read it directly into an R data frame. Afterwards, we changed a few variables to factor and date classes. We then used the dplyr select function to choose only the columns and time range (2018-01-01 to 2021-10-31) we wanted to focus on.

There are 9 variables that have missing values, and the price_drops has the most missing data based on the % rows missing bar plot. We do notice that median_list_price, median_list_ppsf, and new_listings have the same missing pattern. Since new_listings represents the total number of homes with a listing added date during the given time period, median_list_ppsf represents the median price of the most recent listing price, and median_list_ppsf shows the median price of the most recent listing price divided by the total square feet. There are correlations between these three variables, which means missing in one column is likely to be missing in another column. We may use the median or mean value of that variable to fill up those missing data, or we could build a model to predict the value for future data visualization. By column discussion, the following columns had zero missing values: period_begin, period_end, region_type, state, state_code_ property_type, median_sale_price, homes_sold, parent_metro_region. Sold_above_list, months_of_supply, pending_sales, new_listings, median_list_ppsf, median_ppsf and avg_sale_to_list, all had less than 5% of their values missing, meaning that it is fine to proceed with normal analysis of these variables. Finally, price_drops had a substantial amount of missing data (around 20%). However, this variable ended up not being used in our analysis. As shown on the plots, we found Kansas has most of the counts of missing values among all states in the dataset. There are 14 states have no missing value.

The highlighted states are states with an annual absolute difference greater than 5%. The state with the biggest decrease was Hawaii, with an annual decrease of 11.6%. Washington, DC had the largest annual increase in homes sold (7.5%). One possible explanation for the states with strong decreases in the number of new houses listed is the pandemic. States like NY, PA and HI became much less appealing to move to during COVID-19, and thus less homes would be listed in these areas. 5.2 Geofacet Plot This Geofacet plot shows the number of homes sold over time by state. The time range is from January, 2018 to October, 2021. This graph is useful for identifying seasonal trends in number of homes sold, which could be a proxy for the demand for US housing. Additionally, we observed sharp changes in certain states during the pandemic, while the pandemic appeared to have a negligible effect on other states. For example, California, Texas and Florida surprisingly saw an increase in homes sold, while states like Nebraska or Delaware had relatively less change. 5.3 Bar Plot 5.4 Time Series Plot (with mouse over information) These are time series plots, with the upper plot showing months of supply and the lower plot depicting the percentage of listed homes that are off the market in two weeks. Different lines represent different states. This plot is also interactive, and when the reader mouses over a specific line, a popup is displayed showing the month and year of the given data point as well as its value and state. Interestingly, based on the upper plot we noticed a dramatic drop in the months of supply starting at the beginning of the pandemic (2020) and continuing to the present. Additionally, as supply became restricted in 2021, we observed in the bottom plot that the proportion of homes sold in two weeks increased, meaning that homes started to sell quicker. Both of these changes were likely affected somehow by the pandemic, which made it harder to build and sell new homes and therefore reduced supply. 5.5 Map Plot This graph is a heatmap of the difference in price per square foot between 2019 and 2020. Most states had a slight increase in average price per square foot sold, while states like California and Washington had noticeably large increases. Contrary to the general trend, in New York the average price per square foot decreased, meaning that relatively cheaper homes started to be sold. The states colored in gray are ones where no data was obtained. This trend of a general increase in housing prices is possibly caused by the high levels of inflation in the US economy during 2020, and the pandemic. 5.6 Box Plots This boxplot shows the difference in the proportion of listed homes that are off the market in two weeks between 2019 and 2020. The red line represents a difference of 0, meaning no difference between years. This graph shows us that most states had an increase in the proportion, meaning that more homes in 2020 were sold within two weeks than in 2019. Box plots are also useful because they give more information on the spread of the data, and can show outliers. Some states like Alaska have very big ranges, and one should factor this in when choosing to sell a home in a given state. On the other hand, Kentucky had the highest median difference in proportion (approximately 0.15), and a very small inter-quartile range. Massachusetts had a difference in proportion of -0.25, the smallest in the dataset. 5.7 Mosaic Plot This mosaic plot shows the types of houses sold overtime (2018-2021) in different regions of the United States. The bars show the proportion of homes sold that correspond to each type (multi-family, townhouse, condo/co-op, single family residential). We noticed that over time, the number of single-family homes sold dropped in each region, while the number of condo and multi-family homes sold started to increase. We also noticed that this effect was comparatively more pronounced in the Midwest and the Northwest compared to the South and the West, although those regions still followed the general trend. 5.8 Overlapping density plots 5.9 Filled density plot 5.10 Scatter plots "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component Please click “Add bar” or “Remove bar”.
